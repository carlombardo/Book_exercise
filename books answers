the book "Frankenstein" has a wider vocabulary of words, 7734 words, respect to "Pride and Prejudice" with only 7479 words.

Frankenstein's ratio number of words and unique words: 10.1 (tot words in the book: 78122)
Pride and Prejudice's ratio number of words and unique words: 16.7 (tot words in the book: 124749)



From this two ratios we can say that the book "Pride and Prejudice" has a wider vocabulary.
This last statement goes against what I said before
